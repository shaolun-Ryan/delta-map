delta-map
===
Deltamap is a novel graphic approach to emphasis the defference(increment and decrement) between two different periods for a certain ego or group.
The work is updated to the prototype step.
The next step is to build a back-end server to process any data files uploaded by the users and build an awesome webpage.

As soon as another work finishs.
